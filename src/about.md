des: "Our passion is chess, but not just the game. We thrive on the spirit of collaboration and communication that manifests when a community gathers around the chessboard. We delight in the spark of wonder when someone sees a brilliant move for the first time. We live for the checkmates, the stalemates, and every risky or brilliant tactic available. We encourage thinking outside the box, and considering all the options. We believe that our community is our greatest strength, and that's where we choose to invest."
